    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "  In Orellana *et al.* 2016, we have used all the crystal structures of a protein to create an ensemble. What we call an ensemble in this article is a set of structures that are not chimeric, represent the whole protein rather than a single domain of it, and do not contain more than 5 consecutive non-terminal missing residues. As much as we would like to automate this process, preparation of an ensemble often requires manual intervention due to problems like, chimeric constructs or the placement of subunits (clockwise vs. anticlockwise). There is also a decision to be made whether to exclude a structure that has non-terminal missing residues.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  While preparing the ensembles for this article, we have taken care of those problems manually and made a decision to repair the structures  if it was known to represent an important state which does not have any other representatives. Altough it very much depends on the state structure, and the location of the missing residues, we recommend repairing structures with only less than 5 consecutive residues missing. There is an example modeller script that can be used for this.  It is upto the user to fix and include them in the ensemble later.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This tutorial will be using GLIC as an example. Because this was the most challenging ensemble we prepared, it highlights most of the issues the users are likely to encounter. "

    "## HOW TO\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "Before we get started make sure you have installed the pdbParser package, or you are running this notebook in a place where pdbParser is the subfolder. You will find the other required python packages within [github](https://github.com/ozyo/pdbParser) README.md\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the missing residues, pdbParser relies on sequence alignment. If you use pdbParser to prepare a start and an end structure for eBDIMs then the alignment is generated via BioPython. However if you are preparing an ensemble you must install Clustal Omega or run the provided fasta sequence through a multiple sequence alignment tool and save the alignment in fasta format. The installation of Clustal Omega can easily be done via conda. After you install it you should provide the full path for the clustal executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Altough not a requirement, if you want to fix any broken structures you will need a modelling program. We have provided an example script for MODELLER."

    "### Obtaining PDB Files\n",
    "  It can be daunting to find all the available PDB files, and the chains that actually belongs to your protein. The easiset way to do this is to go through the UniProtKB database and pdbParser requires the UniProt ID to prepare the ensemble. \n",
    "  ![title](img/uniprot_ini_search.png)\n",
    "  \n",
    "After finding the UniProt ID you can run the commands below to gather information. Besides the UniProt ID, you also have to provide the total number of chains that are in a biological assembly. Heteromeric structures require a different routine which are not yet supported in pdbParser. However similar logic applies in preperation of such an ensemble that only the shared CA coordinates should be kept, any broken structures should be fixed or excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also provide a folder that exits for inputs/outputs to be read/written. If you use \".\" This will take the current directory for outputs."

    "### Structure Alignment\n",
    "Since we have extracted a common region, and CA coordinates only, all the structures have the same number of atoms. Regardless of the point mutations and the absolute residue number differences we can use almost any alignment tool to superimpose them. For this step you can use your favorite visualizer. In fact it is a good idea to look at the ensemble, and check each structure individually. For example some GLIC structures have a different subunit placement: anticlockwise vs. clockwise. This makes it impossible to superimpose. To fix this issue you could reorder and rename the chains so that the placement matches the rest of the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are finished the alignment of the structures, all you need to do is to combine them, then your ensemble is ready for uploading to the server.Since eBDIMs requires MODEL and END lines in the beginning and the end of the file, you can use a bash loop similar to this to combine them. Since all the structures have the same number of atoms, you can do the alignment with this combined file rather then individual files."
